# Ethics and Limitations

- Sparse-reward planning benchmarks can incentivize high compute spend; leaderboard should report planning cost.
- Partial observability may produce brittle policies that overfit hidden state conventions.
- Open benchmark traces can leak procedural structure and bias future model selection.
- Dual-use risk: planning and model-based control advances may transfer to safety-critical systems without adequate validation.
- The benchmark is not a substitute for real-world evaluation under domain shift and human oversight.
