# WorldModel Gym v0.1.0

Initial public release of the WorldModel Gym benchmark platform.

## Highlights
- Added three procedural long-horizon benchmark environments:
  - `MemoryMaze` (key-door sparse-reward POMDP)
  - `SwitchQuest` (hidden-order switch chaining)
  - `CraftLite` (resource/crafting dependency graph)
- Added dual observation modes (`rgb`, `symbolic`, `both`) and stable semantic episode traces.
- Added deterministic evaluation harness with train/test seed tracks and continual-shift track.
- Added metrics pipeline:
  - `success_rate`, `mean_return`, `median_steps_to_success`
  - achievement completion counts
  - planning cost (`wall_clock_ms_per_step`, imagined transitions, peak memory)
  - model fidelity (k-step reward prediction error)
  - generalization gap and continual transfer metrics
- Added planners:
  - MCTS with simulation/depth budgets and tree diagnostics
  - MPC-CEM with population/iteration/horizon budgets and score distributions
- Added baseline agent suite:
  - random, greedy-oracle, planner-only oracle
  - imagination agent (online world model + MPC)
  - search MCTS skeleton
  - model-free PPO placeholder API
- Added world model baselines:
  - deterministic latent model
  - stochastic latent model (RSSM-style simplified)
  - ensemble wrapper for uncertainty proxy
- Added backend platform:
  - FastAPI runs API and uploads
  - SQLite persistence via SQLAlchemy
  - leaderboard/task/run endpoints
- Added UI clients:
  - Next.js dashboard (home/tasks/leaderboard/run viewer)
  - Expo mobile viewer (tasks/leaderboard/run summary)
- Added reproducibility stack:
  - Dockerfiles and `docker-compose`
  - CI workflow and pre-commit gates
  - `Makefile` automation for setup/lint/test/demo/paper
- Added paper artifacts:
  - imported draft PDF
  - LaTeX manuscript + BibTeX references

## Validation
- `make lint` passes.
- `make test` passes.
- `make demo` runs benchmark + upload flow.
- `make paper` builds paper PDF (with fallback build path when TeX toolchain is unavailable).

## Breaking Changes
- None (first public release).
